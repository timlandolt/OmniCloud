# OmniCloud
A school project that taught us about IaaS, the PHP basics, and product pitching.

We had to develop a hypothetical platform to rent out our different servers. The software dynamically allocates virtual servers onto one of three physical servers. On the frontend, it provides a dashboard for renting and managing the virtual servers, as well as an admin panel that displays the load on the physical servers. At the end, we had to pitch our product to our teacher and the whole class.

We got graded with a `5.9` (`98%`) ðŸ¤—
